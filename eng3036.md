# ENG 3036 - Simulation of Eng Systems
**Things I would like to do before online exam (but may not be able to because I also have to worry about BFM):**
- Make a quick reference sheet for important maths concepts such as converting between ODE and Transfer Functions, Linear Interpolation methods - particularly Newtons Divided Difference since that played an important role in the assignment, ODE to State Space Matrices (which I already know pretty well, but may be useful to have), numerical integration (Midpoint, Simpson, Trapezoid)
- Quick reference sheet for MATLAB simulation structure and simple things like function syntax.
- Quick reference sheet for helpful blocks. Pretty simple but it might be nice to help keep organised.

## Quizlet Set
Not sure if I will continue working on this or updating this, as I think the combined slide deck is a lot more helpful for this kind of exam. However, I will add it here just in case I figure out something else to do with it (maybe can use it to practice multiple choice questions or a few of the theory questions from past papers): [Simulation of Engineering Systems - Helpful Information From Slides](https://quizlet.com/554764747/simulation-of-engineering-systems-helpful-information-from-slides-flash-cards/?new)

This set is also known as **I am so sleep deprived**.
