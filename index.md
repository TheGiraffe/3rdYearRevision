# Revision 2020 - 2021
Welcome to my attempt to document my revision process.

Since this year 2020 has been so crazy and my life has been so upside down recently, I wanted to create a repository to keep all of my revision resources organised.

If you stumble upon this or if I send it to you, I hope it's somewhat helpful. :smiley:

**Some resources that I should use for writing concisely:**
- [Writing Concisely](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/conciseness-handout/)
- [WRITING EXAM ESSAYS](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/students/docs/study-skills/resource-1-Writing-Exam-Essays.pdf)
- [A short guide to writing concisely for Postgraduate Taught students](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/asc/documents/public/pgtwritingconcisely.pdf)
