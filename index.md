# Revision 2020 - 2021
Welcome to my attempt to document my revision process.

Since this year 2020 has been so crazy and my life has been so upside down recently, I wanted to create a repository to keep all of my revision resources organised.

If you stumble upon this or if I send it to you, I hope it's somewhat helpful. :)
