# ENG 3011 - Biological Fluid Mechanics
**What I would like to do in an ideal world, but probably have no time:**
- Quizlet set of helpful concepts - though there are a lot of maths terms so maybe Quizlet is not the best thing for this
- Quick reference notepage full of important formulas

## Combined Slideshow - all lecture slides put together
Having all of the slides together in one file can be helpful for the open note exam. [All BFM Slides](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/2424523d_student_gla_ac_uk/EV_6n5RQ8sBOsU2xJ7f1YJEBEYFC6-5iPwEyRxOIoZQ1KQ?e=O5d68L)
