# ENG 3038 - Microscopy and Optics

**Things that I realised when taking the exam:**
- Potentially start with the maths first, then the writing later. At least don't do all the answers in order because that is an easy way to get overwhelmed.
- Try to stay concise, it's easy to accidentally spend half your time on one question.
- Make sure you understand the applications, advantages, and disadvantages of various techniques and technologies.
- Make sure you know the procedure for applying the various microscopy methods, techniques, and modalities.

## Quizlet set with "helpful information" from slides
I.e. most of the text from the slides (and some images where there were formulas with symbols that would not copy properly) condensed into one place, can also export as a glossary or table. Also known as **Mother of all Note Sheets**.
